## Overwiev
This project showcases a custom website developed during a bootcamp, where I practiced containerization and implemented various observability tools.

## Features

### Containerization
The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.

### Observability Tools:
Amazon CloudWatch: Provides real-time monitoring for performance metrics and logs.  
AWS X-Ray: Enables tracing of requests as they travel through the system, providing deep insights into service performance.  
Honeycomb.io: Delivers high-level observability, allowing fine-grained debugging and tracing of distributed systems.
